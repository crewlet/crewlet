# ADR-0072: A seat's executor session is a sealed object its turn's row names

- **Status:** accepted
- **Authority:** `internal/executordomain`
- **Enforced-by:** `internal/objstore/references.TestEveryTableThatNamesAnObjectIsDeclared`, `internal/objstore/references.TestTheGraceOutlastsTheLongestUnrecordedUpload`, `internal/executordomain.TestTheExecutorDomainIsACertifiedDomain`, `internal/executordomain.TestASessionOpensOnlyWhereItsRowNamesIt`, `internal/executordomain.TestACaptureOfAnObjectPastRecordWithinIsRefused`, `internal/executordomain.TestALateCaptureNeverRollsASessionBack`, `internal/executordomain.TestAnEndedTurnTakesNoFurtherCapture`, `internal/executordomain.TestAnEndAbsorbsWhatItsTurnsFirstLaunchRead`, `internal/executordomain.TestTheSeatBudgetReleasesTheOldestEndedSessionsFirst`, `internal/engine.TestTheExecutorLogFitsBesideTheNineAtTheOperatorsSmallestVolumes`
- **Measured:** a coding CLI's session of a day's work compresses to one or two mebibytes and is bounded here at 32 MiB; at the reference company's 3 000 turns a day the log that names the sessions grows about 29 MB a day, while the sessions themselves would be gigabytes; crewlet-operator's smallest data volumes leave 704 MiB (11Gi, objects in S3) and 320 MiB (14Gi, beside the nats bucket) above the nine logs before this one, and this log takes 64 MiB of it
- **Tag-status:** unreleased

## The decision

A seat's executor session — the coding CLI's own transcript, captured so a
later turn on the same conversation, in any box on any node, continues it — is
stored as **one sealed object per capture in the fleet's object store**
(ADR-0026), under a key the store mints, and is named by **one row per
(seat handle, turn)** of the `executor` state-log domain on
`CREWLET_EXECUTOR_LOG`, the tenth domain of the register. Every record about a
turn is **arbitrated on its conversation** (the seat's handle and a digest of
the conversation's key, or of the turn's own id for a turn with none) and
declares the conversation, or the whole seat, as its scope, so every rule over
a conversation is decided from one snapshot of it in log order. The object is
sealed under the fleet keyring in a streaming format with associated data
binding it to `executor/<seat>/<turn>/<object key>`; a capture naming an
object older than `objstore.RecordWithin` is refused, a capture whose
(launch, capture) ordinals are not newer than the row's writes nothing, and an
ended turn is terminal.

What happens to a row is the domain's and nothing else's: a later turn's `end`
absorbs the conversation's ended rows its first launch read, a seat's byte
budget releases the oldest ended sessions, the company's conversation retention
deletes a row past its last instant (never one whose run is live), and the
mailbox retirement deletes a removed seat's rows. A person's removal does not
reach these rows yet, as it did not reach the conversation ledger they
replace; later records amend this one with the erasure, the capture and the
restore.

## Why the obvious alternatives are wrong

**A volume per node, or a PVC.** A session must reach the next turn's box,
which may be on another engine pod or on e2b; a volume would need every engine
pod to mount every other's, could not reach e2b at all, and would be a second,
Kubernetes-only store the object collector, its audit and the backup cannot
see — the store per node ADR-0026 already refused.

**The memory changelog.** A seat's memory is a compacted subject per row with
no ordering across subjects, and the rules here are over a whole conversation
in log order: which ended turn is the head, which rows a turn's end absorbs,
which attempt at one unit of work survives. A compacted log cannot decide
those, and it declares no barrier, so a launch could not read the head at
`linearizable`.

**The coordination store.** A value of mebibytes per turn in a bucket every
lease, ledger and counter of the company shares, held for the conversation
retention: the bucket is sized for kilobytes, and a full one stops the fleet
claiming seats.

**One row per conversation that each turn's capture takes over.** It reads as
simpler — the conversation's session is the row's object — and it is an object
carry: a row that stops naming one turn's object and starts naming another's,
which ADR-0027 (as ADR-0036 amends it) allows only inside one artifact, because
the collector judges an object by whether any row names it. Two turns running
on one conversation at once would also overwrite each other's session. A row
per turn names only its own object, and the conversation's head is a read.
