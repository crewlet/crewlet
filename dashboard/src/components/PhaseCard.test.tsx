/**
 * A round is ONE block, in the DOM as well as on screen.
 *
 * `rounds()` joins a phase's narration and its tool calls on the number they
 * share, and lib/phases.test.ts proves that join. What is asserted here is the
 * half a reader actually sees: that the join survives into the markup, so a
 * round's thinking, the prose it said and every call it asked for are inside
 * one `.round` element and nothing else is. The complaint that prompted these
 * was "we are not grouping the thinking with its tool call" — the data was
 * grouped and the rendering did not say so.
