/**
 * Which zone the fires after the next one are worked out in.
 *
 * The engine resolves a schedule's own timezone and evaluates the expression
 * there (`internal/schedule/entries.go`, `Expr.FireTimes`), so a reading aid
 * that worked the same expression out in UTC did not merely drift across a
 * daylight-saving change — it was wrong by the zone's STANDING offset on every
 * row of every company that does not run in UTC. This panel is the only place
 * in the dashboard that predicts a fire rather than reporting the one the
 * engine already computed, so it is the only place that can be wrong this way.
