// The OPERATOR catalogue: the same tools a seat holds, offered to a person's
// own AI assistant.
//
// # One implementation, two writers
//
// Every entry here is the same value [Register] files into a seat's registry.
// The only thing that differs is who a write is attributed to, and that is
// [WorkDeps.Actor] — a single field — rather than a second copy of ten tools.
// Two copies drift on exactly the parts nobody looks at: which field is
// trimmed, which default applies, what a refusal says. Only one of the two is
// ever tested, and it is never the copy that broke.
//
// # What is deliberately NOT here
//
// The tools that only make sense INSIDE a turn: the memory tools (a diary
// belongs to a seat, and an operator has none), the skill tools (a skill is
// loaded into a phase), `a2a_ask` (a colleague ask is answered by waking a
// seat, and there is nobody here for the answer to come back to),
// `run_sandbox` (a detached run resumes a suspended phase that does not
// exist), and `lookup_colleague` — which would be useful, but resolves
// against the turn's own org and has no other source.
//
// What is left is the surface an operator's assistant actually needs: read
// the board, file and move work, read and write the wiki, search what the
// company knows.

// OperatorDeps are the halves an operator surface can serve.

// OperatorTools is the catalogue for one operator surface.
//
// A tool whose dependency is absent is OMITTED, on [Register]'s own rule: a
// company on Jira has no native tracker, and an assistant shown a tool that
// always fails learns to distrust the whole catalogue.
//
// The order is the order an operator's assistant meets them in: read before
// write, work before knowledge. Nothing depends on it, and a stable one means
// two boots of one config advertise the same list.
